# High Availability and Scalability Infrastructure

![Alt text](./Architecture%20-%20FlowChart/Application%20Architecture.png)

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a **highly available, scalable, and production-grade infrastructure** for a Django-based web application. The architecture integrates **Jenkins for CI**, **Terraform for infrastructure provisioning**, and **ArgoCD for continuous delivery**, ensuring efficient deployments, robust scalability, and streamlined workflows.

### Key Features

1. **CI/CD Workflow:**

   - **Continuous Integration (CI):**
     - Jenkins automates the CI pipeline, building, testing, and validating application changes.
     - Terraform scripts are triggered by Jenkins to provision cloud infrastructure, such as AWS EKS clusters, load balancers, and RDS databases.
   - **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
     - ArgoCD ensures Kubernetes manifests are deployed and synced to the cluster, maintaining the desired application state.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

   - **Terraform for AWS Provisioning**:
     Provisions critical resources:
     - **VPC**: Networking, subnets, and gateways.
     - **EKS**: Kubernetes cluster management.
     - **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic.
     - **IAM Roles**: Manages access and permissions.

3. **High Availability and Fault Tolerance:**

   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) dynamically adjusts application pods based on resource usage.
   - Amazon EKS nodes use autoscaling groups to ensure infrastructure scales to meet demand.
   - RDS Multi-AZ deployment provides database redundancy and fault tolerance.

4. **Scalability:**

   - Kubernetes ensures horizontal scaling of application pods and infrastructure nodes.
   - Cost efficiency is achieved through autoscaling mechanisms that respond to traffic patterns.

5. **Centralized Logging and Monitoring:**

   - **Fluent Bit** aggregates application logs and forwards them to the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch and Kibana).
   - **Prometheus and Grafana** provide robust monitoring and alerting:
     - Preconfigured Grafana dashboards visualize resource utilization, request latencies, and alerts.
     - Prometheus monitors infrastructure and application performance metrics.

6. **GitOps with ArgoCD:**

   - ArgoCD leverages **ApplicationSet** to streamline and automate the deployment of multiple applications in the Kubernetes cluster.
   - GitOps practices ensure that all application and infrastructure changes are version-controlled.

7. **Automated Workflow:**

   - Developers push code to GitHub.
   - Jenkins CI pipelines:
     - Build and test Docker images.
     - Trigger Terraform scripts for infrastructure updates.
   - ArgoCD syncs Kubernetes manifests for deployment.

8. **Database Setup:**
   - A highly available **RDS PostgreSQL** instance stores application data with Multi-AZ replication.
   - **Redis** acts as a caching layer to optimize database performance and reduce latency.
